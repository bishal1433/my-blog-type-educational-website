Online classes are not only cheap but also conveniently arranged for those who are working. What else a student would want if he gets free classes that too online and for that Youtube is best online platform.But the problem is youtube is so vast that nowadays people cannot find the perfect channel.So we decide to provide structured courses from youtube on informative videos and structured course related videos.
